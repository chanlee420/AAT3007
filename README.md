This repo is for Final Project of AAT-3007, Network Media.

I will write down some features I put in.

1. Google Search on top-right, allowing user to search whatever they want in Google.
2. Controller on middle-right, allowing user to move and search page quickly.
3. using min-width and media query to keep whatever that is not in-content text (such as header, search box, controller, images, etc) safe from decreasing size of browser.
4. keeping the least width of content area as width of browser size, allowing header and footer out of users eye.
